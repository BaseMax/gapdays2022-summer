## GAP Days in general

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to discuss, influence, and
contribute to the future development of GAP. To streamline each meeting, the
organisers usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in GAP
itself, and its packages, via short talks.  However, the focus of the meetings
is on development, with talks playing only a minor role.  As enough GAP experts
will be around for advice and technical support, the meetings offer particularly
good opportunities for people to work on their own packages. At the end of the
week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.

Please visit [gapdays.de](https://www.gapdays.de) for a list of all GAP Days.

The theme of this GAP Days will be “Matrix Object and Packages (?)”.
During this GAP Days, we aim to survey, understand, and develop TODO.

We will also include a small number of talks during the GAP Days about GAP. 
If there is a particular topic in this area that
you would like to hear a talk about, then please include details in the comment
box at registration, or email us later.

We would like this GAP Days to be an opportunity for all interested people with
little knowledge of the insides of GAP to join in: this includes undergraduate
students, PhD students, post-docs, and more experienced mathematicians. You will
be able to meet us and each other, and learn about GAP development and
algorithmic group theory in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
