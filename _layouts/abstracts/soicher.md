### Clique and design finding in parallel using GAP, GRAPE, DESIGN and C

I will describe a new hybrid GAP/GRAPE/C program for determining the cliques
with given vertex-weight sum in a graph whose vertices are weighted with non-zero d-
vectors of non-negative integers. This program is designed to exploit graph symmetry and
may be used for parallel computation on an HPC cluster, such as the QMUL Apocrita
cluster. Some research applications to determining the clique number of a graph and to classifying certain combinatorial designs will be presented.
