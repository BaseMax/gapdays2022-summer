### GAP for Permutation Pattern Classes

I will discuss the recent GRAPE package functionality which exploits
the automorphism group of a graph in the computation of its chromatic
number. In particular, I will point out the GAP permutation group machinery 
which is used.

We will look at one of the few non-groups related GAP packages ([PatternClass](https://gap-packages.github.io/PatternClass/)) and learn about permutation patterns. The study of permutation patterns began in earnest with Donald Knuth's consideration of stack-sorting in 1968 and has evolved in to a multi-faceted research area with work in computational combinatorics, statistics, and bio-informatics.
We will look at the sorting and encoding side of permutation patterns and how GAP has been utilised for it.
